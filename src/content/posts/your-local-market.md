If you've ever taken a prediction market number at face value -- say, 62% for a Senate candidate in Iowa -- you've probably been misled. A 62% backed by $400,000 in open interest and a one-cent spread is a fundamentally different signal than a 62% in a market with $800 and a spread you could drive a truck through.

Every day, we pull data from Kalshi and grade every House, Senate, and gubernatorial market on three dimensions: **volume** (how actively the market trades), **spread** (how tight the bid-ask gap is), and **open interest** (how much capital is at stake). These roll up into a single letter grade, A through F.

- **A** -- Deep, active, tight. The price is a genuine signal.
- **B** -- Solid with minor weaknesses. Trustworthy with a grain of salt.
- **C** -- Mediocre. Directionally useful, not gospel.
- **D** -- Thin and unreliable. More decorative than informative.
- **F** -- Essentially no real market. The number is close to meaningless.

This is not a forecast. We're grading the thermometer, not predicting the weather. The table below updates daily.
