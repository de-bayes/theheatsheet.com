If you've ever looked at a prediction market and taken the number at face value -- say, 62% for a Senate candidate in Iowa -- you've probably been misled. Not because the number is necessarily wrong, but because you have no idea how much conviction is behind it. A 62% backed by $400,000 in open interest and a one-cent spread is a fundamentally different signal than a 62% in a market with $800 and a spread you could drive a truck through.

That's the problem we set out to solve with Your Local Market.

## The Core Idea

In baseball, not all batting averages are created equal. A .310 in 50 at-bats means almost nothing; a .310 over a full season tells you something real. The same intuition applies to prediction markets. The headline probability is the batting average -- but without knowing the sample, the context, the liquidity underneath, you're reading a number without understanding what it actually means.

Our grading system is designed to answer a simple question: how much should you trust this market's price?

## What We Measure

Every day, we pull data from Kalshi and score each race across three dimensions. These roll up into a single letter grade -- A through F -- for every House, Senate, and gubernatorial market.

### Volume

Trading volume tells you how actively the market is being updated by real participants. A market can have decent standing liquidity but barely trade, which usually means the price is stale and nobody is actively incorporating new information. High volume means the price is being stress-tested constantly, which, on the whole, produces better estimates.

### Spread

The bid-ask spread is the gap between the best available Yes price and the best available No price. In a healthy market, this is one to three cents. In a thin market, it can be ten, fifteen, even twenty cents -- which means the "probability" could reasonably be anywhere in a wide range. We penalize wide spreads heavily because they indicate genuine uncertainty about where the fair price even is.

### Open Interest

Open interest reflects the total value of outstanding positions. It tells you how much money is at stake -- how much skin is in the game, so to speak. High open interest means real capital is committed and real people are exposed to being wrong, which tends to improve price accuracy. Markets with trivial open interest are essentially opinion polls with a dollar attached.

## How the Grade Works

We combine these factors into a composite liquidity score between 0 and 1, applying a nonlinear curve so that early gains in liquidity matter disproportionately more than marginal improvements at the top. The score then maps to a letter grade:

- **A** -- Deep, active, tight markets. The price here is a genuine signal.
- **B** -- Solid markets with minor weaknesses. Trustworthy with a small grain of salt.
- **C** -- Mediocre. The price is directionally useful but don't treat it as gospel.
- **D** -- Thin and unreliable. The probability is more decorative than informative.
- **F** -- Essentially no real market. The number displayed is close to meaningless.

The thresholds are calibrated so that the distribution feels right -- not forced into a bell curve, but reflective of the actual state of prediction markets in 2026, where House races are, broadly speaking, dramatically less liquid than Senate races.

## What This Isn't

This is not a forecast. We are not predicting who will win. We're grading the quality of the prediction market itself -- the instrument. Think of it like a thermometer. We're telling you whether the thermometer is well-calibrated and properly placed. We're not predicting tomorrow's weather.

## Why It Matters

Prediction markets are increasingly cited by journalists, campaigns, and political analysts as if they are oracles. Sometimes they are -- liquid, well-traded markets on high-profile races can be remarkably accurate. But the vast majority of prediction markets, especially in down-ballot House races, are thinly traded, wide-spread, and unreliable. Treating an F-grade market's price the same as an A-grade market's price is a category error, and one that, on the whole, nobody else is systematically flagging.

That's the gap we're filling. Not all 62 percents are created equal, and now you can see why.
